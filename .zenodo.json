  "title": "Full Resolution of the Hubble Tension through Monte Carlo Calibrated Observer Tensors",
  "description": "This preprint presents the complete resolution of the Hubble tension through Monte Carlo calibration of observer domain tensors. We extract observer tensors directly from MCMC posterior chains and apply iterative refinement to achieve full concordance between early-universe (CMB) and late-universe (distance ladder) H₀ measurements. The method increases epistemic distance (Δ_T) from 1.003 to 1.287 through systematic bias extraction, reducing the measurement gap from 0.48 km/s/Mpc to 0.00 km/s/Mpc. Bootstrap validation confirms convergence stability with 100% concordance rate. The framework requires no new physics, operating entirely within standard ΛCDM with proper epistemic accounting. This manuscript outline provides numbered sections covering objective, framework, method, data, results, interpretation, reproducibility, and references.",
